# Learning ggplot2

We are learning ggplot2 it's going to be amazing

## Plotting graph
To build ggplot, we need to do some steps
1. specify the data
```{r, echo=false}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```
2. define aesthetics by selecting the variable to be plotted and the variable to be presented such as size, color, shape etc.
```{r, echo=false}
ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy))
```
you can see that the graph does nit show any graphic information. it is because we do not add a formula which defines any graphical representation
3. select graphical representations which is provided by the package
```{r, echo=false}
ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point()
```
